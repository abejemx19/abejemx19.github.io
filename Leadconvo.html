<h1>The moral imagination | Robert Wright & John Paul Lederach</h1>

<!--Add a text body-->
<p> 
    hi John Paul hey Bob how you doing I'm doing well good to be with you good to have you Lenny introduces 
    I'm Robert Wright this is the right show you are John Paul Lederach and you are ifWikipedia is correct I
     think you still have an affiliation with Notre Dame right were you a professor of interestprofessor of 
     international peace building yeah senior advisor at humanity United where you are at the moment 
     theirheadquarters in San Francisco that's correct now it is it is Christmas time so Iactually want
      to start out with a little little Bible reading if you don't mind it's from the the Nativity story
       in Lukenow there were in the same country Shepherds living out in the fields keeping watch over their 
       flock by night and behold an angel of the Lord stoodbefore them and the glory of the Lord shone around
        them and they were greatly afraid than the angel said to them donot be afraid for behold I bring you 
        good tidings of great joy joy which will be to all people for there is born toyou this day in the City 
        of David a saint a savior who is Christ the Lord and this will be the sign to you youwill find a baby 
        wrapped in swaddling clothes lying in a manger and suddenly there was with the angel amultitude of the 
        heavenly host praising God and saying this is the payoff gloryto God in the highest and on earth peace 
        goodwill toward men and I think becauseof this I've always actually associated that line with Christmas
         peace on earth goodwill toward men so I thought it madesense to bring a a peacemaker on that's what you
          do for a living you're also aChristian for that matter you're I think you're a Mennonite right that's 
          correct yes and Mennonites are very seriousabout peace right absolutely you and youwere your father was
           a Mennonite Minister is that right yes that's true he was minister for quite a few yearsand then came 
           across to be a professor at a small Mennonite College where my mother also taught okay and you're quite well 
           known in this field the the the peacemaking field you've written they're rollin books you wrote a bookcalled 
           the moral imagination you also wrote a book whose title I think was changed it was originally journey toward
           reconciliation and then was a republished as reconcile yeah it was republished about 15 years later underthe
            title of reconcile it has some revisions and a couple of new chapters that were added okay so you know I 
            guessI'm I'm hoping to get some encouragement from you because I've got to say looking around the world there
             have been timeswhen things looked better there is a lot of conflict and you know the conflictthat gets the most
              publicity tends to be in the most volatile volatile parts of the world and also to be conflicts ithas the involvement
               of great powers so we're hearing a lot about Syria and we should be because it's a totally horrible situation 
               but meanwhile youknow I heard on the news this morning about Sudan and South Sudan in a civil war I have forgotten
                about sitting inyou know I mean this you know things like this are kind of bubbling up all the time so I want to 
                start by askingyou I mean you've been at this a long time you've seen real successes at peacemaking and you've been part of themand you document them in your books but how are you feeling looking around honestly how optimistic or pessimisticare you about the world yeah well I youknow from the background that I come from I approach the words optimism andpessimism a bit differently I I would say I retain a great sense of hope whichis different than those two words what I typically find in a lot of settings where I work these are settings thathave had very long-standing patterns of deep conflict and open violence sothere's a lot of structural and Justices forms of exclusion where people feel that their basic well-being is not takencare of they're not respected they have less much less dignity than they would want and they last for a long time andso when I have this odd phrase in fact they even title one of my chapters thegift of pessimism when people are optimistic I tend to become abit more pessimistic because I think we have to keep ourselves as realistic aspossible about how hard change is to accomplish when a lot of things have happened that have harmed people forlong periods of time but when people are really pessimistic I am optimistic because I think it gives us a basis fromwhich we see a better and more clearly the challenges that lay ahead Sudan South Sudan for example that you justmentioned I think probably you were referring to South Sudan in that yesterday ban ki-moon at the UN near theend of his term released a statement that said the country is on theprecipice of a genocide if we need to be cautious and aware that would be a signI think of of pessimism but at the same time that same morning I received a notefrom several sources in South Sudan around the work of church leaders theSouth Sudan Council of Churches a range of people including some bishops who hadjust met and who are saying you know basically this message listen we knowwe're in deep trouble we know that we need to change things we know that theinternational efforts are important but ultimately we in South Sudan have tofind a way to talk with each other and respect each other differently and it's our responsibility now I take that tosay two things one the situation is dire and two it is significant that peopleare saying we have responsibilities and we must rise to our greater imaginationand capacity to respond to those because I think ultimately these conflicts arenot handled well from the outside those can create temporary spaces and andprotections but if they have to have a deep-rooted necessities issues that havehistoric patterns to them in the past so ok yeah I noticed in looking at yourbook the moral imagination you started with several case studies you start start with anexample from Ghana and I noticed that sometimes and you're telling it does seem to come down to even like oneindividual doings do it whose part of the involved in the conflict or the thethreatened conflict just doing something particularly wise that is a kind of abreakthrough moment and I found that I didn't know whether to find that inspiring or depressing you know inother words it's great that there are such people but it also suggests thatthere's no magic formula right and that to some extent you are putting your hopes on contingency well yes and no Ithink you know the the four stories that I opened that book with the background to those is that I was particularlyinterested in how in the most unexpected of ways people and communities that weremost affected by violence had a capacity to find a surprising way of engagingwith the challenges that they faced the particular case that you're mentioning was actually embedded in a context of awider set of community processes but was in which at a given moment a personresponded differently in a public setting than what was expected to be theresponse to what had been a form of integration and humiliation and in thatresponse opened up a whole different way that the communities themselves began toengage with each other and I think it shows us rather consistently that thereis no one single formula by which these things happen that our individualchoices do make a difference that communities that sometimes we feel are the hardest hit and the hardest impactedby violence are also the communities that demonstrate the greatest resilience and capacity for imagination theirsurvival in part depends on how they respond to the challenges that they havebefore them and for me those things have been deeply inspirational that doesn'tlower my interest in studying understanding and developing skillfulresponses to those but I'm also very cognizant that coming out of conflictrequires creativity requires building you know developing something thatbrings into existence that which right now does not exist and that that is akind of in other words peace is a constant birthing process you're bringing forward something that has tointerrupt disrupt the patterns that have been so powerful around people and thesource of what that might be is notsomething that's easily controlled by a particular person or group it oftenhas a certain level of you know it's like the creative act it's something that no one fully expected and that'swhat I find time and again is that we meet to accompany develop alongside ofour skilled analytical approaches to conflict the space for what essentiallyis something more akin to the artistic process that is the openness to that creativity that is within our reach thatwe have not always fully embraced okay so this is what you mean by moralimagination because that's a term that's been used in different ways by different people I actually have a particular way I've used it it's different from the wayyou use it but you're talking about literally imagining I guess a kind ofsolution that hasn't necessarily transpired before in other words there's something you're having to literallyimagine something novel in order to kind of think your way out of the problem yeah well I so i differentiate in the inthe book the moral imagination well the first thing I'd note is that the phrase itself dates back a couple of centuriesso it's not something that was originated certainly not by me but evenin the thoughts of the recent decades it and when I began to look fairlysystematically I found in the range of about 20 or 25 books either had a subtitle or a title theyused the phrase the moral imagination and they cut across a wide set of disciplines and I was curious I readthrough all of them I was curious to know what what is it that seems to cohere around this and then I comparedthat to the situations that I was looking at in reference to protracted conflict and so I actually land on sortof four lenses so four forms of imagination that described what I referto as the moral imagination and the first one of those is that people thatare caught in inconsistent 
    patterns of deep conflict developed the theimagination that they themselves are part of a web of relationships that isinclusive of their enemies and I refer to this sometimes as what we could callthe grandchild imagination in other words ultimately the decisionsthat I make and that we make inclusive of our enemies our grandchildren arelinked both the well-being of Mike shoulder and the well-being of their children have something to do with howwe choose to respond today so that that first one is imagining yourself in a web of relationship that includes those whoyou may even fear and does that entail thinking of the relationship as somewhat nonzero-sum another one's imagining thatyour fortunes are to some extent positively correlated and intertwine yeah absolutelyand that that the choices that you're making mutually affect each otherthe second imagination that I saw rather consistently in places especially wherepeople were able to move beyond the cycles of violence was the the it'sessentially an imagination about complexity and and within that what itsuggests is that conflict is not about exactly what you said a kind of azero-sum binary it's not either this or that it is often much more complex andthat leads essentially to equality around imagination which is to stay curious to retain and sustain acuriosity but that curiosity is both about the other those who we may fear but it's also acuriosity about ourselves why did we get hooked and react in the ways we do and as a curiosity about the situation thecontext and the issues that ability to sustain curiosity is also an ability tolive you know it with a greater deal of patience in the face of ambiguity and Ithink one of the keys that we have grown less patient with is we don't want ambiguity or I just want to eliminatethat complexity you get rid of it and so we choose a portion of something as complex and we lift that forward as theultimate truth and as we know there are a lot of things that are happening simultaneously around situations thatentail our lives and our relationships and building a capacity for patiencecuriosity I think is really that's the second imagination so is there can I gender is there an example of this kindof insisting on an overly simple unambiguous view of things I mean isthere an example it comes to mind from a current conflict or a kind of thing that people do in that well so I I think theone that most captivated my attention I mean obviously we've just come to a really tough election period and a lotof things got framed as us in them right either you're with this issue you're opposed to it right you're going to dothis or that if you go back a few Dec you know not long ago to the period ofSeptember 11 the one of the things that came out of that is the world is dividedbetween us and them either with us or you're against us was one of the phrases that politically gained a great deal ofprominence the world is far more complex than that the world of our enemies is far more complex than that if youportray a world of threat that you see out there it is not a world that is madeup with a simple binary and I think one of the things that we get ourselves in a lot of trouble with and one of thethings that we have to learn in our current social and political sphere right now is the ability to sitalongside the fact that we are not monoliths made up of two sides this isjust not the reality those that voted one way or another have a very complex set of things thatmay have brought them to those conclusions or those perspectives and the ability to have curiosity about the story that sitsbehind how you came to see the world the way you did the experiences that havebeen formative for the ways that you view a particular thing those are the places where we touch our humanity andthe richness of who we are and it is I think an effete achill to the very nature of being a human being that welimit that to a way that you are either this or you are that we are most commonly both and by the way Syria is Ithink a good example of that kind of complexity when you look at the interrelationship I mean you know Russiaand Turkey have enough things in common that they are now doing business together in a certain sense even thoughnot so long ago turkey shot down a Russian plane and it was the mortal enemy and you know it's it's anextremely complicated situation and in a way I think what it boils down to is to remember that you know game theoristsdistinguish between zero-sum and non zero sum games but the truth is in real life there are very few purely zero-sumrelationships there are very few cases your most bitter enemy if you think about it you can imagine an outcome thatwould be worse for both of you than what you've got right now what that means is it's a nonzero-sum it's not a purelyzero-sum situation right that's exactly right and I think you know a lot of thetheory behind conflict in the early viewpoints that developed around thefunctions of conflict especially from the work of Louis crows are quite some years ago was the notion that conflicthas a variety of different functions and though one of those is the conflict becomes the most harmful when we when wepush it into a an absolute binary that actually healthy societies healthyrelationships have a cross-cutting effect so if it was you and me Bob our if on every single issue we were onopposite sides we're in a deep trouble but if we notice that we're both parentsand we struggle with what to do with teenagers if we notice that on the school board thing I fall on this sidebut you have fallen that one but on the new public building process I agree with you that I don't want this road coming through our neighborhood inthis way and on the question of what we should do about you know the mining thatis happening just outside of town we may fall in other words where we have cross-cutting ways that we agreed welearned that we can be together and have disagree it actually has a binding effect it has what's referred to asconflict also achieving some coherence among who we are as it is impossible tokind of cultivate that awareness because an example I've always thought of is in the United States there are probably fewgroups that are more kind of wary of Muslims than evangelical Christians yet if you look at their values I mean ifyou if you found them discussing what kind of values should be instilled in kids in the public schools you'd find atremendous amount of agreement and but but that doesn't you don't see that I don't see that realized much maybe Ihaven't looked in the right places and of course there are people now including politicians almost devoted to keepingpeople from seeing that kind of commonality but I guess my question is is that the kind of thing you've beeninvolved in a lot of these situations around the world is it possible to cultivate an awareness of thenonzero-sum link in a way that really proves transformative absolutely andwhat some of what you just described it goes precisely the point I was trying to make so if we imagine ourselves on theother sides of what is portrayed as a religious divide that's incompatible butwe put on for a period of time different identity hats so if we're sitting together and asking the question whatwhat do we hope for in education for our children what do we hope for in terms of opportunity for teenagers looking foremployment what do we hope for in terms of access to recreation in sports sportsfor example is one of the areas that has been explored a lot around conflict zones that where you can engage inactivities where people are coming together for something they both have a passion about now our identities arewe're passionate about soccer right not Muslims and Christians we're passionate about something suddenly youhave an arena that permits you to notice how you as human beings have a varietyof things that both motivate and identify you and that talk to you in reference to your deeper sense of whoyou are that that has much to do with creating a wider view where you don'tpermit a single identity to be the only one that defines who you are in therelationships that you may have that saw if it leads to my third and fourth pointon this imagination the third one is precisely this how in a given setting where it has become really divided butthere's very little communication and contact what kind of creative activitywhat kind of creative imagination can be brought to bear that permits us to readlook at who we are and how we will choose to be together and that for me was the third imagination really had alot to do with the fact that the creative act is always within ourpotential that we have the ability to find ways of creating meaning andframing and approaches many times totally unexpected that transcend theways that this has created great difficulty and and animosity and thefourth one which it maybe is the most critical because a lot of the stories I deal with are in settings where there's a good bit of violence is thatconsistently I found that people had an imagination about risk and for me riskmeans that you're entering into something that you where you don't fully control the outcome if if you knowbefore you do it that you're going to control what comes out of it it actually is not a form of riskwhat risk really means is that you're stepping into a mystery into the unknown and in the context of conflict thatoften has to do with two things that are happening simultaneously it is a risk toreach out to those you fear and it is a risk to those who are in yourown community and the pressure they will put on you if you open relationship withthose they fear or those they view as the enemy and I think this actually requires risk requires a form of what Iwould call social courage social courage is both the ability to reach out topeople who are on the other side of the divide but social courage is also thethe capacity to turn and face in within our own tribe within our own community withi
    n our own group and say some of the things we are doing are not the best ofwho we could be and when you see that happening especially in the form of dehumanization it's the courage torehumanize those situations of conflict both in terms of the other and in termsof the dignity that we agree to offer to those who are different than us and Ithink that that notion of risk was one of the ones I found rather consistent because many of the people that I workwith when they take a risk it isn't just a risk of whether I'll be rejected in this conversation it actually can be arisk around the question of your life and survival right and you know I meanyou take a situation like Israel Palestine you see that on both sides I mean you see on the one hand groups likeyou know the military veterans the group called breaking the silence which tries to call attention to kind of crimescommitted by Israeli soldiers and in the West Bank those people are you know Idon't know if ostracized is too too heavy a word but I mean they have a hard time getting taken seriously inmainstream Israeli discourse and on the other side of course you know Palestinians who make certain kinds ofovertures you will be accused of various things I mean is is there it's a veryhard it's a very hard thing to deal with when when to show courage is in fact tomarginalize yourself if not even to invite you know some kind of personal physical risk yeah no absolutely and Ithink that's precisely why I refer to it as imagination its imagination about that risk tootypically the people that I have been close to that do that do not imagine thesort of ultimate outcomes that it may lead to they're imagining the first small step what is it that we choose todo today right that's more commonly how I've experienced it so if you took forexample the bereaved parents society Association in Israel Palestine the context you were using these are parentswho have lost family members or children in particular one of the things that they do there they do a variety of veryinteresting things this Palestinian Israelis is that where let's imagine that there is a bombing or that there isa bus that's blown up or that there is a mortar shell that landed in a particular location they go together to the localthe hospital most proximate to that place and they give blood together now this to me is ahighly symbolic act of imagining that I am in relationship with even those who Imay fear that I have the ability to sustain a curiosity about the situationabout the people about what's happening that I choose a creative act in this case the giving of blood to replaceblood that's taken but to do it together with the people who on both sides have been harmed and to do that as a riskmeaning that there will be people in my community that don't understand me and there's certain of only people on theother side who don't understand it but this that that capacity is what I wouldcall the moral imagination it's attempting to rise to the rehumanize ation of the situation that has becometotally humiliating and dehumanized and that is at the core of where I think much of our initiative around peace hasto actually be placed of course there are people who would say you've just shown us how hopeless it is becausenotwithstanding the courage and imagination of these people things have rarely looked so grim for a two-state solution at least in the near term inIsrael Palestine but you managed to keep your own hope alive at least I mean Imean I gather you have seen situations where I mean you you are you you youseem to feel sure that that these little efforts even though they exist on themargins of both of these society's efforts like this are worth sustainingand in the long run those are the kind of the main sources of hope absolutelyabsolutely because we we have no noopportunity and no time lost to sustain an ability to understand better whowe're going to choose to be as a global and human family and to me this is itcan certainly be forwarded by the actions of national polity in large-scale negotiations in Colombia forexample it's one of the signs of hope we now have a half century war that iscoming through a process it's not easy there will be a difficult implementation period but it was a context that hasparallel to Israel Palestine in in sitting as one of the longest standingmost difficult situations for years if not decades communities across Colombiahave been engaging in the very things that became significant for what now hasto happen as the steps that move forward and I think our our task is not to askthe question where is the perfect solution that solves this our task is toask the question how do I respond today with what I have access to that makes adifference in the lives where I am at and that serves as example of the direction that we are trying to proceedand those are the things that I think we have to do and that remain the greatest signs of hope peace ultimately is aboutthe quality of relationships not the quantity of policy or the quantity ofthe weapons that we may have it has to do with the ways in which we engagedirectly with the quality of who are choosing to be with each other that starts in my local communities it startsin the local communities in places that are hard and it starts with the ways in which senators and congresspeople relateto each other it starts in the ways that mayor's engage their issues I mean there is no place outside of which it is notabout human beings choosing to respond to situations we the imagination and care and compassionso how and where do we mobilize that well I think it mobilizes every place that we can find it and I will chooseconsistently to stand alongside and with people who are attempting to do thatknowing that I will also do whatever I can to bring that to a wider scale but Ibelieve firmly that without a core of reconciled people there is nopossibility that Nations reconciled you have to find them whether they are in the exemplar of the Nelson Mandela's andthe de Klerk's who provide a sort of a national figure of that you know Mandela attending a rugby event you knowsymbolic levels or whether it is at the level of four or five people going andgiving blood together across the divide saying we no longer will harbor thislevel of violence in our communities and we don't have access to change everything but those things that we canchange we will do so together that's for me the core of this thing so as part ofthe idea that you kind of never know when some major contingency will unfold that will make prospects look eitherbetter or worse maybe something so horrific will happen that everybody goes we got to do something about this but ina way to prepare for contingency favourable contingencies in in the sensethat of contingencies that can make peace more likely you have to be tending the soil all along just to maximize thechances that when something breaks that has favorable potential it'll break inthe right direction is that that's the idea that's the idea and then it has greater potential for sustainabilitymm-hmm I mean you a lot of what I you know I'm a part of teams of people thatare systematically studying national peace agreements over the last thirty years and we know that peace agreementsaid about a 50% rate return back to war right those that have greater capacityto sustain themselves are usually more detailed in what they're doing but they also contemplate a wider range of thingsthat touch on the lives of people that run from national to local levels there's acapacity to envision this as a whole body politic change as our good friendHarold Saunders used to say worked for many years in the State Department and is engaged you know with the was startedthe sustained dialogue Institute recently passed away this notion that itis about whole body whole level initiative and not exclusively as something that lands as a politicalsolution to a military problem those are the least sustainable agreements theones that are more sustainable have a wider array of things that they do they engage in a wider set of policy thingsbut they also create a wider form of participation where those examples already exist even in the hardest ofconditions you have a much better chance to have the infrastructure necessary to support the change that's needed and arethere any situations that are just so inflamed that you kind of think nowisn't the time it's like even preparing the soil is hopeless and what I'm thinking about is Syria it's like hardto imagine where you would start I mean it's you know there there are so many places where you're you're you're just aphysical risk to even be much less be there and be encouraging anything in particular to happen is Syria a casewhere you just kind of say well we'll just have to wait until you know theyuntil we get to a different place or are you like right now thinking well this iswhat we could be doing in Syria or maybe this is what we people you know are doing in Syria I don't know yeah well Iam Syria is not a place that I have been engaged directly so I only have you know somewhat of a peripheral view of thepotential things that may be going on at any given time so I have to draw parallels from other settings to somedegree and Syria clearly far in a way is probably the biggest breakdown of ourinternational communities early and more constructive responses and the Nationalcommunities within Syria how they've permitted it to come to the place that it's at makes it a particularly dauntingchallenge as you're suggesting but having said that what what I think has to be thought about isnot the question of oh it's too hot and burning too much to do anything it isthat it's burning too hot to do certain things what other things may be possiblewhere and how and I my guess is that a lot of those are happening somewhat atthe peripheries in other words you're working within particular geographies and communities and you're askingquestions what set of people
     in conversations what responses are needed how might the response is needed to ahumanitarian crisis be done in a way that they contribute to rebuilding potential for relationships that havecapacity to think about new and different ways to approach the wider macro challenges that are in place thethis will con texts of the complexity of Syria will require the complexity ofresponse meaning that there will be more than one place in which response is needed and creativity is needed when wewere for example just to go to a different context Northern Ireland over the decades you would have things thatwould begin to show some promise at the political level and then a new round of shootings assassinations or bombingswould take place where it would cycle back down into deep deep divisionanimosity and violence now within that context people that were engaged in saycross community work which would intentionally begin to ask questions ofhow do we continue to work on what we're doing knowing that in the next fiveyears they'll probably three or four times where we can't do certain things what else might we have in place to knowthat when those periods come we still have these things to go to and you know I had some connection for example twoways in which across the paramilitary groups there were ways in which theybegan to coordinate even when they couldn't visibly be seen to do it publicly they had mechanisms that could becreated that would mitigate the level of how far it would cycle right now personally I think a lot of that kind ofwork was a part of why the good Frye was able to overcome some of theobstacles that faced when violence re-emerged that in earlier decades wouldhave kicked it back into absolute devastating tit-for-tat kind of violencethat tended to be the pattern that was in place so you're not asking a questionof whether you have to wait until things are no longer burning you're asking thequestion what kinds of things aren't possible given the circumstances we're in and even if they're small how arethey building blocks for what we're trying to get to that's a that's a different way of framing how you come atthat level of complexity precisely into that imagination about curiosity your curiosity about what's possible tocultivate even in the worst of conditions so Northern Ireland is aninteresting example because it was on the one hand I guess nominally a religious conflict at least in thissense it was Protestants versus Catholics on the other hand it's not really thought of that way I mean there it's like I've never heard anybody saythat this was really over the question of whether you get salvation through you know faith or works or anything right itwas not a big a big kind of theological argument I think people recognize that it was you know these two groups occupydifferent kind of socio-economic issues had different issues different kinds of access to power different grievancesdifferent ethnic identities now in other situations with say you know jihadistviolence people are more inclined to think of it as religious and it's certainly true that they're it's morecomments on of these cases that a religious rationale is put out for the violence but how do you think in thosesituations do you think of religion per se religious belief as the motivating thing or a prominently motivating thingor do you even even think about kind of the causes of these things as opposed to the solutions well certainly the thereligious so the religious imaginaries can come to be highly mobilizing byrealist imaginaries you mean the people who are going to be helpful i well it can be i think well you know as my goodcolleague Scott Appleby in the title of his book talked about it's the ambivalence of the sacredbut the sacred can be drawn upon to justify violence and defending ourselves against the the you know the adversaryor the enemy other and the same sacred backgrounds can be drawn upon tomobilize around reconciliation non-violence other responses toconflicts so religion per se often contains both possibilities what I'mreferring to is how the religious imaginaries are brought to a particular conflict so in northern ireland i agreewith you it was not about it was not a theological debate although those identities and the ways that they drewfrom certain kinds of sources could often reinforce a religious component that were a part of it the jihadist andmore extremist responses that come back counter to the Islamic threat these areoften framed in ways in which people portray them that justify how it is thatwhat you're facing is something that is you know the religious threat to ourelimination and how you mobilize someone to become a part of that which i thinkis is often forms by which religion ismanipulated into the service of certain ways of dealing with socio-economic andpolitical power certainly and so it's a very complex equation I do think thereis a lot to be said for taking religion much more seriously in reference to howsignificant it is in the ways people make sense of their worlds and how they're approaching what it is thatjustifies the actions and the ways of interpreting what's happening around them and this has been a you know in thesecular political world it's been a deficiency religion viewed primarily as a kind of you know it's the non-rationalso let's get this let's push it to the margin so that we can deal with more rational processes in reality conflictis always about the ways people make sense of the world and to get into that you have to comemuch more into their ways of constructing a worldview and the things that they draw from that they associatethings with in order to justify both interpretation and action and thenultimately become to be very much the lens like my glasses the perceptions through which they see what is happeningaround them and how they see themselves and others and in those contexts wherereligion is significant I think we have to have a much greater capacity to sitalongside of how it is that people are making sense of this and to try to find ways to draw the very best of thosetraditions to the fore and to find ways to mitigate parts of our traditions andwe all have them that lead us into deeply at least in my view flawed waysof seeing the complexity of the situations in the human community that we're dealing with okay well this kindof leads to actually the way I had used the term moral imagination and I started doing it before I was aware of your bookmaybe even before your book existed when it was in published 2005 or 2005 yeah okay oh I don't know yeah 2001 September11 was when I first started okay the framework yeah so the way I had usedthe term it's very much relevant to what you just said and my question isn'tabout how to use the term it's more about how important you think this is you know there's a distinction that canbe made between two kinds of empathy like there's the traditional kind emotional empathy where you feelpeople's pain there's what also what psychologists sometimes call cognitive empathy which is just putting yourselfin people's shoes just understanding the way they're perceiving the world andthinking things through regardless of whether you have any personal sympathy for them so you can you can do this withVladimir Putin even if you consider him your enemy you can do it with some young Muslims who may be on the verge ofsigning on to jihadism regardless of how you feel about the person and I've tried to make the case that actually this kindof just sheer perspective-taking is greatly undervalued and possmore important than the other kind of empathy in fact my friend Paul bloom just published a book called againstsympathy by which he just means sometimes emotional empathy actually gets in the way of solutions you knowbut but but my claim has been that this kind of perspective-taking thing shouldI think it should be exercised in all possible cases and there are reasonsthat we often find it hard to do with our enemies or with people we consider our enemies we just find it hard to doclearly and I'm wondering what your your your take is based on your experience onhow important you think that is how hard it is to do and and and so on yeah no Ithink I would concur with a good bit of what you you've just described I'll giveit to you in shorthand in a way that I tend to interact with in particularly University students around this I'vebeen suggesting that in our current context here so one thing is to placeout there how do i empathize whether cognitively or emotionally with Putin that's a very distant thing the questionwe really face is what do I do with the person sitting next to me in the pew who I disagree with what what do I do at thefact that my town voted two different directions over something and now we don't even want to see each other youknow what are we gonna do with this and I think a lot of this comes back to ask the question how will the risinggenerations of this country choose to engage with differences that they actually Co happened you know we cohabitspaces where there is enormous difference so I place it more in the context of the daily and the local so mysuggestion is basically this that you can create three things with then afinal provocation that I add to it the three things are develop more of adiscipline to listen to understand rather than a discipline to listen tofind the nuggets that you can show or wrong or to defend and I think this this very simple shiftfrom listening to defend to listening to understand places you more along thelife story of people in other words you're kind of coming into a way of saying what if we know what's it like tohave grown up in this particular view how did the person arrive at this view right that kind of a notion the secondis that when you speak I think I'll come back to my word courage which has at itsLatin root core or heart speak from the heart which requires a certain level honestyand vulnerability I think one of the things 
     we're often missing is that we're we're we wait until we've been angeredto explode and then we don't actually speak from the heart we speak from somewhere that's about an emotional rushor we're too nervous to say anything that somebody might disagree with so we don't say it very honestly we kind ofback away from who we really are and I think what people want is authenticity I think I can live a lot more withsomebody that's authentic that I disagree with there's somebody that I perceive to be inauthentic you know inone form or another whether that's by way of projection or hiding so when you speak speak from the heart speakhonestly authentically with certain level of vulnerability right the third one is work in the direction ofsustaining a relationship with this person so that it's not a kind of a one-time eventin other words rehumanize your relationship now for me the provocationis pick somebody one person with whom you disagree you know that you havedifferences choose to go to coffee once a month for the rest of your life andyou talk about the thing you disagree about yes so this is what when I saycoffee once a month for the rest of your life you don't have to always talk about thethings you disagree about you may end up talking about you know what's happening in like I said the local school what'shappening with my family you know the decision I'm trying to make about where I'm going for vacation yeahin other words when it is a commitment to a longer-term thing it no longer is an event that becomes a debate it is arelationship within which we have a much wider variety of conversations and wherethe possibility of envisioning each other in a rehumanize duay eliminatessome of the volatility but permits a deeper level of exactly what you weresaying the coming alongside of how it is that someone else sees it without that being a threat that I need to change mymind or that I need to defend something this is what I think is the problem thatwe have we have lost the art of basic conversation the ability to be in aconversation where we can with dignity and respect be alongside a budget you even if we're deeply different and Ithink that's that's the basis the starting point that we have to find some way of recruit ready okay well thank youI know it's 10:00 a.m. where you are and know you have an appointment at 10:00 a.m. but I want to thank you for takingthe time again the name is John Paul Lederach and your your your books include the moral imagination andreconcile conflict transformation for ordinary Christians and I'm sure for therest of the world as well I'm sure they listen to be had for everyone thank you so muchI'm sure you know depending on the particular religious beliefs of our viewers and listeners they can see youas either literally or figuratively doing God's work and and thank you somuch for that and and keep it up I appreciate it Bob thank you okay take care
